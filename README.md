Collaborators

This is a web application that allows the user to make use of the Call of duty rapid API and tracker.gg Apex Api to track their own stats. <br />
Their own stats are compared to a person of high skill and that will allow the user to see where they sit versus people of high skill rating! <br />
We used Tailwind which is a CSS framework that allowed us to stylize the page and allow the application to be more mobile responsive. <br />
Brief instructions on how to use the application, Enter in your Username in the text box and then select the game your account is associated too. <br />
Press Search and stats will display in the two result, if the results do not display it may be due to privacy settings!
